# Project Title
Malware Detection using Universal Sentence Encoder

# Motivation
As new malware variant emerges, we need to be able to determine the behaviour of
malware to detect its presence in our network. 
This project aims to derive techniques to gather malware behaviours/signatures from various internet sources globally by using webscraping techniques. With the malware signatures gathered, proposed method to cross validate and assign a degree of accuracy.
Fueled with my interest in Cybersecurity.
